## About medevice-users

We are a group of people working to define and build a **diabetes data bus**. This bus will support data formats for blood glucose (BG) readings, insulin pump data, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) readings and other data that is of use and interest to people affected by diabetes. We intend to publicly release the diabetes data bus specification so that anyone can develop software or firmware to put data onto or take data off the bus.

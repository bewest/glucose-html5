# Glycemia HTML5 Template

## Middleman template:
  * D3
  * crossfilter
  * vega
  * jquery
  * 

This is a middleman template combining d3 and a bunch of other stuff.
Should help as a stepping stone to help isolate features.  Showing off
on gist/http://bl.ocks.org is great; you can use this template to
assemble the html files, or use middleman as a tool to develop a style
guide or app around your demos.

There are a few D3 demos:
  * heatmap
  * pan/zoom scatterplot
  * timeline

Plus a few pages to experiment with the layout/templating.

It's primed for using html5 to hack on diabetes.

These are not listed in a particular order. We expect list to evolve. 

*   __People with diabetes__ (PWDs). They use the information to improve BG control now and ensure better A1C levels and less glycemic variability. This leads to better quality of life and reduce complications. They don't have to use logbooks.
*   __Parents and family__ of children with diabetes. Gives them remote access to current readings and helps predict low and high BG readings so they help their children avoid issues.
*   __Schools, school nurses and staff__. Provides context to school nurses so they can understand what's happening and how best to deal with it.
*   __Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Staff__. See [[Cognitive Burden Experienced by Intensive Care Unit Nurses 
When Implementing a Tight Glucose Control Protocol|http://www.journalofdst.org/January2012/PDF/Articles/VOL-6-1-SYM7-NG.pdf]] (PDF file)
*   __Healthcare team__: endocrinologists, diabetes educators, nutrionists, etc. They use the information derived from this data. This reduces the workload of interpreting logbooks and the future flood of diabetes data.
*   __Diabetes device companies__. So they can support these standards and evolve them in future.
*   __Insurance companies__. They can support this effort because of the improved PWD outcomes.
*   __Medicare, Medicaid, Veteran's Administration__. Save money and time while enabling better outcomes.
*   __Researchers__. The diabetes data bus gives them access to anonymized data that helps in their research. **Note**: Currently it's very difficult for researchers to gather diabetes data. See [[Data-Mining Technologies for Diabetes|http://www.journalofdst.org/November2011/PDF/Articles/VOL-5-6-REV2-MARINOV.pdf]] (PDF article)
*   __ADA, JDRF, DRI, etc__. These companies raise funds to support diabetes related research and development. They can advocate for device companies to support the diabetes data bus standard.
*   __Non-Governmental Organizations__ (NGOs). The bus enables collection of data to determine which projects are more successful.
